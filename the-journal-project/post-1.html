		<h2><a>WhatsApp unveils coronavirus info hub, donates $1M for fast checking</a><h2>
		<p class="first">WhatsApp  has long grappled with its platform being used to spread misinformation. In the latest move, today it announced two initiatives to fight specifically against fake news and other misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

		<p>The Facebook -owned instant messaging service announced the WhatsApp Coronavirus Information Hub — in partnership with the WHO, UNICEF, and UNDP — to offer simple, actionable guidance, general tips and resources for users around the world to be better informed about the disease and hence reduce the spread of rumors.</p>

		<p>WhatsApp said it is working with the WHO and UNICEF to provide messaging hotlines for people around the world to use directly. These hotlines will provide information and will be listed on the WhatsApp Coronavirus Information Hub. It did not share exactly when the hotline will be ready for use.</p>

		<p>The messaging firm said it is also donating $1 million to the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). The $1 million grant will help in fact-checking for the #CoronaVirusFacts Alliance, which spans more than 100 local organizations in at least 45 countries.</p>
